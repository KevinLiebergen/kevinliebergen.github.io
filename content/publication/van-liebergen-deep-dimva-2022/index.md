abstract: " Online scanners analyze user-submitted files with a large number
of security tools and provide access to the analysis results. As the most popular
online scanner, VirusTotal (VT) is often used for determining if samples
are malicious, labeling samples with their family, hunting for new threats,
and collecting malware samples. We analyze 328M VT reports for 235M
samples collected for one year through the VT file feed. We use the reports to
characterize the VT file feed in depth and compare it with the telemetry of an
AV vendor. We answer questions such as How diverse is the feed? How fresh are
the samples it provides? What fraction of samples can be labeled on first sight?
How different are the malware families in the feed and the AV telemetry?"
