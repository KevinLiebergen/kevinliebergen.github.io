Hi! I am a cybersecurity passionate with a computer engineering and a master in Cybersecurity at the University of Alcałá. I am currently a PhD Student at IMDEA Software Institute under the supervision of Prof. Juan Caballero.

My research focuses on the design, analysis, and implementation of threat hunting approaches and malware analysis. I like to play CTFs, and I am really interested in exploiting, reversing and web challenges.

I have experience as system administrator working with the philosophy of Infrastructure as code (IaC) with tools such as SaltStack, Terraform and Docker and I have worked with hosting clouds such as Google Cloud Platform and Digital Ocean. 

I don't pass the Turing test in the mornings.
