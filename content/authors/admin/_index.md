Hi! I am a Ph.D. Student at IMDEA Software Institute. I am part of the security group lead by Prof. Juan Caballero. I received my M.Sc in cybersecurity from the Universidad de Alcalá (UAH). 

My research focuses on the design, analysis, and implementation of threat hunting approaches, cybercrime, specifically ransomware. I like to play CTFs and I have a genuine passion for all things IT-related.

I don't pass the Turing test in the mornings.
