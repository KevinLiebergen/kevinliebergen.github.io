#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi! I’m a PhD student at the IMDEA Software Institute, where I’m part of the software security group led by Prof. Juan Caballero. My research focuses on how malware and cybercrime operates at scale, measuring and characterizing online abuse, including server ransom(ware) scams and phishing kits. My goal is to shed light on these operations to support stronger defenses and contribute to a safer digital environment. I’ve presented my work at major conferences such as NDSS (San Diego, US), DIMVA (Hamburg, Germany), and JNIC (Sevilla, Spain).

Before joining IMDEA, I earned an M.Sc. in Cybersecurity from the Universidad de Alcalá and worked as a systems administrator consultant. Outside of academia, I enjoy participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and have a genuine passion for cybersecurity and systems.



My Erdös number is 4 (Juan Caballero -> Geoffrey M. Voelker -> Ronald. L. Graham -> P. Erdös).

I transform coffee into code, and datasets into knowledge… Or at least I try to.
